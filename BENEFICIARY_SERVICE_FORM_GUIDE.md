### For Developers

#### Adding the Form to Other Components

```tsx

// In your component
<BeneficiaryServiceFormWrapper 
  chatId={chatId} 
  sendMessage={sendMessage} 
/>
```

#### Customizing the Form

The form can be customized by modifying the `AddBeneficiaryServiceForm` component:

```tsx
import { AddBeneficiaryServiceForm, BeneficiaryServiceFormData } from './components/add-beneficiary-service-form';

// Custom submit handler
const handleSubmit = (data: BeneficiaryServiceFormData) => {
  // Custom logic here
  console.log('Form data:', data);
};

<AddBeneficiaryServiceForm
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  onCancel={() => setShowForm(false)}
  isLoading={false}
/>
```

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User fills out the form with service details
2. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation ensures required fields are filled
3. **Data Processing**: Form data is converted to a structured message
4. **Chat Integration**: Message is sent to the chat system
5. **AI Processing**: The AI processes the message using the `addBeneficiaryService` tool
6. **Database Storage**: Service is created in the database
7. **Response**: Success/error message is displayed to the user

## Form Data Structure

```typescript
interface BeneficiaryServiceFormData {
  name: string;                    // Required
  description?: string;            // Optional
  type: 'one-to-one' | 'one-to-many'; // Required

  expectedDuration?: string;       // Optional
  requirements?: string;           // Optional
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent'; // Required

1. **Validates Input**: Ensures all required fields are provided
2. **Creates Service**: Adds the service to the database
3. **Returns Response**: Provides success/error feedback

## Error Handling
